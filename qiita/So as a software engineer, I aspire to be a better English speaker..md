This is the 16th article for the “write something” advent calendar looking back on the year. As I wrote the topic yesterday: [勉強を「楽しみ」に変えて中毒になれば毎日続くよねと Duolingo を続けて思っている話 #Duolingo - Qiita](https://qiita.com/e99h2121/items/189b654cfe874fccb767) for today's article, I want to express my challenge to be a better English speaker/writer to be better software engineer. Let's go~~

## My English is not powerful.

I had been staying in Shanghai for around 3 years before my daughter was born. I had to go back to Tokyo for my pregnancy. I spend time using English and Chinese in Shanghai. So my English was made in China.

This is my 孤独のグルメ in Shanghai...

It was a very impressive experience for me, and I have confidence. I want to show my gratitude for the boss and colleagues, but still I want to improve my skills. Because my English is just survival English.

I wish I could be better spearker. 


## Learn English.

In my previous job, our boss and colleagues were unique. So it was very exciting and very comfortable for me because I love such a unique environment. I could say "no" anytime if I cannot accept any opinion or unacceptable idea if only we can discuss.

But one of the thing I need to understand is...

Just "not to do" should not be equal with "not to learn". 
It means trying something should be extremely valuable rather than not taking any action.

Especially regarding English. If it is necessary, I should learn.

- I wish to tell what I want for the engineer internationally. 
- I wish to express my appreciation for the engineer.
- I wish to interact more impressively with our boss overseas...


## Be better English speaker.

In this 2024, I felt clearly that my English is still weak. So I decided my mind that to be more strong English speaker.

- Speak anything.
- Speak anything if there is any time with [勉強を「楽しみ」に変えて中毒になれば毎日続くよねと Duolingo を続けて思っている話 #Duolingo - Qiita](https://qiita.com/e99h2121/items/189b654cfe874fccb767).
- Just think in English if there is any time.
- Communicate more actively: [自分の要件を伝える英語 #コミュニケーション - Qiita](https://qiita.com/e99h2121/items/06d0405f60f7fa6ddddd)
- Regard that My English is not powerful.
